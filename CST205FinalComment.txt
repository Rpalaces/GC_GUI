Who worked on which functions/classes/files?
	Jesse Anacleto worked on the primer functions.
	Chenyu Su worked on sequences matching functions(heavily used in the primer function) and documentation.
	Roberto Palacios worked on user interfaces.
Descriptions of important code blocks:
	The primary function is the workhorse function that tests the target sequence and creates the primers.  
        The target sequence is entered into a stylish gui, that displays the results of the primer functions tests.
